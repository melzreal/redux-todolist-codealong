This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Working code after doing this codealong:

You'll have to Add your own firebase credentials - follow the instructions on the tutorial, then where it says "Project Overview" hit the little Gear cog icon to go to "Project settings" > "Your Apps" > Select the third symbol to register a Web App > Give it a Name > Copy the values of the var firebaseConfig = { } into the firebase.js firebaseConfig of this repository and you're all set. Just "npm install" and "npm run" to start the server!

 I thought it'd be useful to upload the finished code since there were a few little bugs with the codealong (maybe the bugs were on purpose so you get debugging practice?) and also because now mapdispatchtoprops needs to replace what the original had as "componentWillMount()" 

 Happy learning, happy coding :fire:
